\chapter{Preliminary Results/System Prototype}
This chapter presents the preliminary results between the comparison of trained machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest,  Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-nearest Neighbors (KNN).  This chapter will also present the model evaluation and the comparison of model performance. 

\section{Comparison of Model Performance}
Figure 4.1 presents the comparison results of machine learning models on the morphological traits of the combined  male and female \textit{t.granosa} datasets.
