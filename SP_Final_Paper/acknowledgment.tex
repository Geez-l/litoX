\textbf{i. Adricula's Acknowledgment}

\hspace{1em} I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my beloved family who supported me all throughout my academic journey. My Mama Madelene, and Papa Juvy, who had made countless sacrifices to make me the person I am today. To my Sister, Aianna, and cousins Jayson, Joana, and Joel who have helped me unwind after a long and stressful days of academic load. To my aunt, Tita Lybel– thank you for believing in me since day one. You are always there to guide me in every decision I make.  And to my Lola Lydia, who has been my inspiration in finishing my studies. Your reminders to eat more and stay safe have always kept me grounded and cared for, and I appreciate the extra allowance you always give me whenever I go back to Miagao. Without such a supportive family behind me, I couldn’t have done this without you.

To my pretty college friends, Arianne, Gliezel, Karielle, Kane, Kzlyr, and Sharah thank you for making my college experience bearable. The laughter and joy that we shared together lessened the stress I felt. Here’s to all the rants, tsismis, and bangs memories we had, look how far we become. I will forever cherish the memories we made together through ups and downs. Thank you for the encouragement along the way and just by being there by my side. 

To my co-researchers, Gliezel and Kane, this is not possible without you. Your insights and passion for this research inspired me along the way. Thank you for the teamwork, initiatives, and hard work. I will miss the dorm to hatchery to computer lab to dorm adventures with you! 

To my second home, UPV Balay Gumamela, our dorm manager and to all the staff– thank you for checking up on me, to always make me feel welcome, and to ensure that we had a comfortable stay. 

And lastly, for the people who believed in me and have always been there for me every step of the way, even when life was harsh–I am forever grateful for your unwavering encouragement, support, and just by believing that I can make things possible.
