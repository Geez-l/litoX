	\textbf{To our family, advisers, and the people of science:}
	
	\vspace{0.85cm}
	A heart full of love, \\
	To those who gave wings so we can fly. \\
	Stood firm even through moments of doubt. \\
	A jovial harmony and warmth that kept us steadfast. \\

	A word of thanks is an understatement, \\
	To those who cast their light upon our way. \\
	A source of wisdom even when the road grew heavy, \\
	A north star that guided us through this journey. \\
	
	\vspace{0.75cm}
	Immeasurable esteem we offer, \\
	To the unsung heroes of science and innovation, \\
	Whose drive and dedication uplift and inspire, \\
	Changing lives with boundless determination. \\
